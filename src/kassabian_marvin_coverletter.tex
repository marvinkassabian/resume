	\textbf{Internal Organizer}\newline

Dear Hiring Committee,\newline

I am writing to apply for the Internal Organizer position with SEIU Healthcare Michigan. I am motivated by organizing work that is grounded in strong relationships, consistent follow-through, and collective problem-solving, and I am seeking to continue this work within a member-led union committed to improving the lives of healthcare workers across Michigan.\newline

Over the past several years, I have been actively involved in grassroots organizing through the West Michigan Care Collective, where I support direct actions, facilitate trainings, conduct outreach, and work collaboratively to address workplace and community challenges. This work has required building trust with participants, engaging emerging leaders, and contributing reliably to shared goals. Through this experience, I have learned the importance of accountability, clear communication, and sustained engagement in building collective power.\newline

In addition to my organizing experience, I bring a professional background that emphasizes planning, coordination, and record-keeping. My earlier career in software development strengthened my ability to manage complex workloads, maintain accurate documentation, and work effectively within team-based structures. I am comfortable adapting to changing priorities, working independently in the field, and supporting collective decision-making processes.\newline

I am seeking to grow as an internal organizer within a union that values member leadership, strategic organizing, and solidarity. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills, discipline, and commitment to the work of SEIU Healthcare Michigan.\newline

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support your organizing efforts.\newline

Sincerely,\newline

Marvin Kassabian
