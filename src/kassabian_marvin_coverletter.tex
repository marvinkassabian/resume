Dear Hiring Manager,\newline

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer II position at TGW. Over the past decade, I have delivered and supported software solutions in C\#, Java, and other object-oriented languages, with a focus on reliability and maintainability.\newline

At eoStar, I developed and maintained C\# desktop applications and Xamarin.iOS mobile apps, supporting production deployments and troubleshooting complex issues in real-world environments. Much of this work revolved around warehouse management software, giving me direct experience with the domain and its unique challenges. I have architected and delivered enterprise-scale platforms, collaborating with developers and subject matter experts to meet customer needs and project milestones.\newline

Since my time at eoStar, I have continued to expand my technical and collaborative skills across a variety of environments and projects, as detailed in my resume. My experience adapting to new technologies, frameworks, and business domains has strengthened my ability to quickly learn and contribute to any team. Whether working with different IDEs, optimizing code, implementing robust testing strategies, or supporting software in production, I have consistently demonstrated flexibility and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions. This adaptability ensures I am well-prepared to take on the diverse challenges and responsibilities of the Software Engineer II role at TGW.\newline

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to TGW's software solutions and support your customers' success.\newline

Sincerely,\newline

Marvin Kassabian
