At Superior Technologies Research, I led the delivery of a business-critical HR platform, driving CI/CD, automated testing, and system integration. My roles at eoStar and Calder Solutions further strengthened my skills in legacy enhancement, TDD, and continuous improvement.\newline

I am practiced in Agile, Lean, and XP disciplines, including paired programming and test-first development. I have worked closely with cross-functional teams to design and implement scalable, secure systems, and am comfortable with SQL, PostgreSQL, and automated testing tools such as Junit and Jasmine.\newline

I am passionate about adopting new technologies, optimizing performance, and supporting secure, high-quality development. My collaborative, agile approach and experience in regulated industries make me a strong fit for your team.\newline

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to contributing to Stefanini’s mission and supporting innovative, business-critical solutions.\newline
