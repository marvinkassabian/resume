	\textbf{SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) Position}\newline


Dear Hiring Manager,\newline



I am excited to apply for the SDET position. With over 12 years of experience as a software engineer, I have consistently championed quality, test automation, and close collaboration with QA teams to deliver robust, reliable software solutions. While my primary roles have not been in dedicated QA positions, I have worked extensively alongside QA professionals—most notably at eoStar, where I partnered with QA to design, implement, and validate test cases for complex cross-platform applications.
\newline

In my recent role at Superior Technologies Research, I led the development of a comprehensive automated test suite, achieving full route coverage across all application domains. I implemented test-driven development (TDD) practices and integrated automated testing into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring rapid feedback and high-quality releases. My experience includes building and maintaining test automation frameworks for both UI and API layers, using modern tools such as TypeScript and Go, and collaborating with feature teams to define acceptance criteria and promote a test-first mindset.
\newline

I am particularly drawn to this SDET opportunity because it emphasizes both technical leadership in automation and hands-on support for Agile teams. I am adept at guiding test case design, supporting exploratory and manual testing, and enabling teams to take ownership of quality. My background in developing enterprise-scale systems, combined with my passion for scalable, maintainable automation, aligns well with your vision for modernizing test strategy using tools like Playwright and TypeScript.
\newline

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team's success by advancing your test automation strategy and supporting high-quality, efficient releases.
\newline


Sincerely,\newline

Marvin Kassabian
