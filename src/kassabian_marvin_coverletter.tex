\textbf{Controls Software Engineer Position}\newline

Dear Hiring Manager,\newline

I'm writing to express my interest in the Controls Software Engineer position at Dematic. With 12+ years developing software in C\#, C++, Python, Go, and Java, I'm excited to contribute to your Product Development SCS organization.\newline

My experience aligns with your key requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Object-oriented programming} in C\#, C++, Python, Go, and Java for enterprise and real-time applications
    \item \textbf{Legacy system enhancement} designing C++ functionality for proprietary database migration to SQL Server
    \item \textbf{Real-time applications} with TensorFlow deployment on iOS devices
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive testing} using TDD and automated testing frameworks with full test coverage
    \item \textbf{Documentation standards} including design specifications, operational procedures, and test documentation
    \item \textbf{Agile development} with milestone-driven planning and CI/CD deployment using Docker and Kubernetes
\end{itemize}

At eoStar, I enhanced legacy C++ applications and developed C\# desktop applications alongside Xamarin iOS mobile apps. More recently, I've architected enterprise microservices with comprehensive documentation while meeting critical delivery milestones.\newline

I'm drawn to Dematic's emphasis on software quality and structured development. My commitment to excellence and team collaboration align well with your requirements.\newline

Thank you for your consideration.\newline

Sincerely,\newline

Marvin Kassabian
